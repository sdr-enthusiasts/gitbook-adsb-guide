# Preparing Your System

## Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi single-board computers (SBCs) are a popular choice for flight data enthusiasts running this software.

If you're generally unfamiliar with Linux or working with Raspberry Pi, the [official Getting started guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) is a great place to start, and will walk you through the process of installing Raspberry Pi OS - you'll want to enable SSH.

If SSH'ing into a server and editing a text file with nano or vi is something you've done before, you might consider installing [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/docs/install/).
