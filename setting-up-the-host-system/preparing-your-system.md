# Preparing Your System

## Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi single-board computers (SBCs) are a popular choice for flight data enthusiasts running this software.

If you're generally unfamiliar with Linux or working with Raspberry Pi, the [official Getting started guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) is a great place to start, and will walk you through the process of installing Raspberry Pi OS - you'll want to enable SSH.

If SSH'ing into a server and editing a text file with nano or vi is something you've done before, you might consider installing [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/docs/install/).

## Hints for Linux Newbies

Collecting ADS-B data with an SDR is a great project to learn about Linux. When you initially prepare your device by installing an OS, you might do so by connecting a display, keyboard, and mouse directly to your device, much as you would any traditional desktop PC. However, after some intial configuration, you might move your computer to another location, at which point it might be helpful to access your new Linux device remotely.
