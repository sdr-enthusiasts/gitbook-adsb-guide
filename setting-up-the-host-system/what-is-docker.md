# Docker Overview

## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a popular containerization platform used to package and deploy software applications. It allows developers to create self-contained, portable environments that can be easily shared and run on any machine, regardless of its underlying operating system or infrastructure. Docker uses a layered file system and minimal resource overhead, making it fast and efficient for creating, deploying and managing applications. For more details about Docker, please check out their [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

## What is Docker Compose?

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create, start, stop, update, etc all the services defined for your application.
