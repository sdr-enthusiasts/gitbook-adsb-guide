# Re-Serialise SDRs

As most RTL-SDRs ship with the same serial number, confusion may be caused if more than one SDR is ever present. It is a good rule of thumb to change your SDR serial numbers to match the frequencies they receive for.

The remainder of this guide assumes that:

* The SDR used for ADS-B Mode-S \(1090MHz\) reception will have a serial number of `1090`
* The SDR used for ADS-B UAT \(978MHz\) reception \(if used\) will have a serial number of `978`.

To set these serial numbers:

Unplug all SDRs, leaving only the SDR to be used for 1090MHz reception plugged in. Issue the following command:

```text
sudo docker run --rm -it --device /dev/bus/usb --entrypoint rtl_eeprom ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf -s 1090
```

You should be presented with the following. Your details may differ slightly, however ensure the device's new serial number will be `1090`. Press `y` to proceed.

Next, if you intend on receiving ADS-B UAT \(978MHz\) data with a second SDR, Unplug all SDRs, leaving only the SDR to be used for 978MHz reception plugged in. Issue the following command:

```text
sudo docker run --rm -it --device /dev/bus/usb --entrypoint rtl_eeprom ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf -s 978
```

You should be presented with the following. Your details may differ slightly, however ensure the device's new serial number will be `978`. Press `y` to proceed.

Unplug all SDRs and then plug them back in again to make the system aware of the new serials. A reboot will not do that.
