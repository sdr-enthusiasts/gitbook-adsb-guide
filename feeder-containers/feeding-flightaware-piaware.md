# Feeding FlightAware \(piaware\)

[FlightAware](https://flightaware.com/) is a digital aviation company and operates the world's largest flight tracking and data platform.

`piaware` is a client program to securely transmit ADS-B and Mode S data to FlightAware.

In exchange for your data, FlightAware will give you an Enterprise Membership. If this is something of interest, you may wish to feed your data to them.

The docker image [`ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware) contains `piaware` and all of its required prerequisites and libraries. This can run standalone \(without the `ultrafeeder` container\), however for flexibility it is recommended to run with `ultrafeeder`, and this is the deployment method that will be used in this guide.

## Getting a Feeder ID

### Already running PiAware?

You'll need your _feeder-id_ from your existing feeder.

To get your _feeder-id_, log onto your feeder via SSH and issue the command:

```bash
piaware-config -show feeder-id
```

### New to PiAware?

If you're already running PiAware and you've followed the steps in the previous command, you can skip this section.

You'll need a _feeder-id_. To get one, you can temporarily run the container, to allow it to communicate with the FlightAware servers and get a new feeder ID.

Inside your application directory \(`/opt/adsb`\), run the following commands:

```text
docker pull ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware:latest
source ./.env
timeout 60 docker run --rm -e LAT="$FEEDER_LAT" -e LONG="$FEEDER_LONG" ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware:latest | grep "my feeder ID"
```

The command will run the container for 60 seconds, which should be ample time for the container to receive a feeder-id.

For example:

```text
$ timeout 60 docker run --rm LAT="$FEEDER_LAT" -e LONG="$FEEDER_LONG" ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware:latest | grep "my feeder ID"
Set allow-mlat to yes in /etc/piaware.conf:1
Set allow-modeac to yes in /etc/piaware.conf:2
Set allow-auto-updates to no in /etc/piaware.conf:3
Set allow-manual-updates to no in /etc/piaware.conf:4
2020-03-06 06:16:11.860212500  [piaware] my feeder ID is acbf1f88-09a4-3a47-a4a0-10ae138d0c1g
write /dev/stdout: broken pipe
Terminated
```

As you can see from the output above, the feeder-id given to us from FlightAware is `acbf1f88-09a4-3a47-a4a0-10ae138d0c1g`.

You'll now want to "claim" this feeder.

To do this, go to: [https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/claim](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/claim) and follow the instructions there.

## Update `.env` file with feeder-id

Inside your application directory \(`/opt/adsb`\), edit the `.env` file using your favourite text editor. Beginners may find the editor `nano` easy to use:

```bash
nano /opt/adsb/.env
```

This file holds all of the commonly used variables \(such as our latitude, longitude and altitude\). We're going to add our `piaware` feeder-id to this file. Add the following line to the file:

```text
PIAWARE_FEEDER_ID=YOURFEEDERID
```

* Replace `YOURFEEDERID` with the feeder-id that was generated in the previous step.

For example:

```text
PIAWARE_FEEDER_ID=acbf1f88-09a4-3a47-a4a0-10ae138d0c1g
```

## Deploying piaware feeder

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file that was created when deploying `ultrafeeder`.

Append the following lines to the end of the file \(inside the `services:` section\):

```yaml
  piaware:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: piaware
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
    environment:
      - BEASTHOST=ultrafeeder
      - LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - LONG=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - FEEDER_ID=${PIAWARE_FEEDER_ID}
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log
```

If you are in the USA and are also running the `dump978` container with a second SDR, add the following additional lines to the `environment:` section:

```yaml
      - UAT_RECEIVER_TYPE=relay
      - UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978
```

To explain what's going on in this addition:

* We're creating a container called `piaware`, from the image `ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware:latest`.
* We're passing several environment variables to the container:
  * `BEASTHOST=ultrafeeder` to inform the feeder to get its ADSB data from the container `ultrafeeder` over our private `adsbnet` network.
  * `LAT` will use the `FEEDER_LAT` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `LONG` will use the `FEEDER_LONG` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `TZ` will use the `FEEDER_TZ` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `FEEDER_ID` will use the `PIAWARE_FEEDER_ID` variable from your `.env` file.
* For people running `dump978`:
  * `UAT_RECEIVER_TYPE=relay` tells the container to pull UAT data from another host over the network.
  * `UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978` specifies the host to pull UAT data from; in this instance our `dump978` container.
* We're using `tmpfs` for volumes that have regular I/O. Any files stored in a `tmpfs` mount are temporarily stored outside the container's writable layer. This helps to reduce:
  * The size of the container, by not writing changes to the underlying container; and
  * SD Card or SSD wear

## Update `ultrafeeder` container configuration

Before running `docker compose`, we also want to update the configuration of the `ultrafeeder` container, so that it generates MLAT data for piaware.

Open the `docker-compose.yml` and make the following environment value is part of the `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` variable to the `ultrafeeder` service:

```yaml
      - ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlathub,piaware,30105,beast_in;
```

To explain this addition, the `ultrafeeder` container will connect to the `piaware` container on port `30105` and receive MLAT data. This data will then be included in any outbound data streams from `ultrafeeder`.

## Refresh running containers

Once the file has been updated, issue the command `docker compose up -d` in the application directory to apply the changes and bring up the `piaware` container. You should see the following output:

```text
ultrafeeder is up-to-date
Creating piaware
```

We can view the logs for the environment with the command `docker compose logs`, or continually "tail" them with `docker compose logs -f`. At this stage, the logs will be fairly unexciting and look like this:

```text

```

We can see our container running with the command `docker ps`.

Once running, you can visit `http://docker.host.ip.addr:8081/` to access PiAware's "SkyAware". From there you need to configure your location and altitude on the FlightAware's website. To do this, click on the blue button marked `Go to my ADS-B Statistics Page` on your "SkyAware". When the FA website loads, click on the gear icon near your feeder name and configure your location and height _using the same values you set in your .env file_. If you do not configure these values via the FA website MLAT will not work for your PiAware feeder.  You can also log onto FlightAware's website and click on the `My ADSB` link at the top of the page, and see your statistics, configure your location and altitude and other settings.

Remember, if you change your location and altitude on FlightAware's website, you'll need to update your `.env` file locally \(and re-run `docker compose up -d` from your application directory\)!
