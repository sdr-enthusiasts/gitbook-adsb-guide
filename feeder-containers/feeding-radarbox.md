# Feeding RadarBox

[RadarBox](https://www.radarbox.com/) is a flight tracking company that displays aircraft & flight information in real-time on a map. RadarBox offers flight data such as latitude and longitude positions, origins and destinations, flight numbers, aircraft types, altitudes, headings and speeds. Based in Tampa, Florida, with a R&D center in Europe, RadarBoxâ€™s business operations include providing related data to aviation service providers worldwide.

`rbfeeder` is a RadarBox's client program to transmit ADS-B and Mode S data to RadarBox.

In exchange for your data, RadarBox will give you a Business Plan. If this is something of interest, you may wish to feed your data to them.

Personally, I really like their visualisation. Overlaying the flight data with precipitation and cloud cover looks fantastic.

The docker image [`mikenye/radarbox`](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-radarbox) contains `rbfeeder` and all of its required prerequisites and libraries. This needs to run in conjunction with `readsb` \(or another Beast provider\).

## Getting a Sharing Key

### Already running `rbfeeder`?

If you're not a first time user and are migrating from another installation, you can retrieve your sharing key using either of the following methods:

* SSH onto your existing receiver and run the command `rbfeeder --showkey --no-start`
* SSH onto your existing receiver and run the command `grep key= /etc/rbfeeder.ini`

### New to `rbfeeder`?

You'll need a _sharing key_. To get one, you can temporarily run the container, to allow it to communicate with the RadarBox servers generate a new sharing key.

Inside your application directory \(`/opt/adsb`\), run the following commands:

```bash
docker pull mikenye/radarbox:latest
source ./.env
timeout 60 docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    --network adsb_default \
    -e BEASTHOST=readsb \
    -e LAT=${FEEDER_LAT} \
    -e LONG=${FEEDER_LONG} \
    -e ALT=${FEEDER_ALT_M} \
    mikenye/radarbox
```

The command will run the container for one minute, which should be ample time for the container to connect to RadarBox receive a sharing key.

For example:

[rbfeeder] [2020-11-20 08:55:05]  Your new key is g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9.
```

As you can see from the output above, the sharing key given to us from Radarbox is `g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9`.

You should now claim your receiver:

1. Go to [https://www.radarbox.com/](https://www.radarbox.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Claim your receiver by visiting [https://www.radarbox.com/raspberry-pi/claim](https://www.radarbox.com/raspberry-pi/claim) and following the instructions

## Update `.env` file with sharing key

Inside your application directory \(`/opt/adsb`\), edit the `.env` file using your favourite text editor. Beginners may find the editor `nano` easy to use:

```bash
nano /opt/adsb/.env
```

This file holds all of the commonly used variables \(such as our latitude, longitude and altitude\). We're going to add our `rbfeeder` sharing key to this file. Add the following line to the file:

```bash
RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY=YOURSHARINGKEY
```

* Replace `YOURSHARINGKEY` with the sharing key that was generated in the previous step.

For example:

```bash
RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY=g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9
```

## Deploying `rbfeeder`

### SegFault Fix

As the `rbfeeder` binary is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, the `rbfeeder` binary expects a file `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` to be present, and contain the CPU temperature. If this file doesn't exist, the `rbfeeder` binary will crash and restart every few minutes. For more information, see [here](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-radarbox/issues/16#issuecomment-699627387).

The `mikenye/radarbox` container is multi-architecture, and accordingly you might not be running on a Raspberry Pi.

As a workaround, we can "fake" this file by performing the following additional steps:

#### Create "fake" directory structure

Inside your application directory \(assumed to be`/opt/adsb`\), run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ./data/radarbox_segfault_fix/thermal_zone0
echo 24000 > ./data/radarbox_segfault_fix/thermal_zone0/temp
```

This creates a fake directory structure that contains a fake CPU temperature file that reads 24 degrees Celsius.

#### Create docker volume

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file that was created when deploying `readsb`.

Add the following lines to the `volumes:` section below the `version:` section, and before the `services:` section:

```yaml
  radarbox_segfault_fix:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      device: /opt/adsb/data/radarbox_segfault_fix
      o: bind
```

This creates a volume containing our fake directory structure. We will map this through to the feeder container to prevent the SegFault from occurring.

### Create `rbfeeder` container

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file that was created when deploying `readsb`.

Append the following lines to the end of the file \(inside the `services:` section\):

```yaml
  rbfeeder:
    image: mikenye/radarbox:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: rbfeeder
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - readsb
    volumes:
      - "radarbox_segfault_fix:/sys/class/thermal:ro"
    environment:
      - BEASTHOST=readsb
      - LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - LONG=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - ALT=${FEEDER_ALT_M}
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - SHARING_KEY=${RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY}
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log
```

If you are in the USA and are also running the `dump978` container with a second SDR, add the following additional lines to the `environment:` section:

```yaml
      - UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978
```

To explain what's going on in this addition:

* We're creating a container called `rbfeeder`, from the image `mikenye/rbfeeder:latest`.
* We're passing several environment variables to the container:
  * `BEASTHOST=readsb` to inform the feeder to get its ADSB data from the container `readsb` over our private `adsbnet` network.
  * `LAT` will use the `FEEDER_LAT` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `LONG` will use the `FEEDER_LONG` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `ALT` will use the `FEEDER_ALT_M` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `TZ` will use the `FEEDER_TZ` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `SHARING_KEY` will use the `RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY` variable from your `.env` file.
* For people running `dump978`:
  * `UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978` specifies the host to pull UAT data from; in this instance our `dump978` container.
* We're using `tmpfs` for volumes that have regular I/O. Any files stored in a `tmpfs` mount are temporarily stored outside the container's writable layer. This helps to reduce:
  * The size of the container, by not writing changes to the underlying container; and
  * SD Card or SSD wear

Once the file has been updated, issue the command `docker-compose up -d` in the application directory to apply the changes and bring up the `rbfeeder` container. You should see the following output:

```text
readsb is up-to-date
adsbx is up-to-date
piaware is up-to-date
fr24 is up-to-date
Creating rbfeeder
```

We can view the logs for the environment with the command `docker-compose logs`, or continually "tail" them with `docker-compose logs -f`. At this stage, the logs will be fairly unexciting and look like this:

```text
[s6-init] making user provided files available at /var/run/s6/etc...exited 0.

We can see our container running with the command `docker ps`.

Once running, you can visit the RadarBox website, and go to "Account" &gt; "Stations" and click your station to see your live data.
