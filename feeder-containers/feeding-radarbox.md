# Feeding RadarBox

[RadarBox](https://www.radarbox.com/) is a flight tracking company that displays aircraft & flight information in real-time on a map. RadarBox offers flight data such as latitude and longitude positions, origins and destinations, flight numbers, aircraft types, altitudes, headings and speeds. Based in Tampa, Florida, with a R&D center in Europe, RadarBoxâ€™s business operations include providing related data to aviation service providers worldwide.

`rbfeeder` is a RadarBox's client program to transmit ADS-B and Mode S data to RadarBox.

In exchange for your data, RadarBox will give you a Business Plan. If this is something of interest, you may wish to feed your data to them.

The docker image [`ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox) contains `rbfeeder` and all of its required prerequisites and libraries. This needs to run in conjunction with `ultrafeeder` \(or another Beast provider\).

## Getting a Sharing Key

### Already running `rbfeeder`?

If you're not a first time user and are migrating from another installation, you can retrieve your sharing key using either of the following methods:

* SSH onto your existing receiver and run the command `rbfeeder --showkey --no-start`
* SSH onto your existing receiver and run the command `grep key= /etc/rbfeeder.ini`

### New to `rbfeeder`?

You'll need a _sharing key_. To get one, you can temporarily run the container, to allow it to communicate with the RadarBox servers generate a new sharing key.

Inside your application directory \(`/opt/adsb`\), run the following commands:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox:latest
source ./.env
timeout 60 docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    --network adsb_default \
    -e BEASTHOST=ultrafeeder \
    -e LAT=${FEEDER_LAT} \
    -e LONG=${FEEDER_LONG} \
    -e ALT=${FEEDER_ALT_M} \
    ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox
```

The command will run the container for one minute, which should be ample time for the container to connect to RadarBox receive a sharing key.

For example:

```

As you can see from the output above, the sharing key given to us from Radarbox is `g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9`.

If the script doesn't output the sharing key, it can be found by using the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it rbfeeder /bin/sh -c "cat /etc/rbfeeder.ini" | grep key
```

Command output:

```text
key=g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9
```

## Claiming Your Receiver

1. Go to [https://www.radarbox.com/](https://www.radarbox.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Claim your receiver by visiting [https://www.radarbox.com/raspberry-pi/claim](https://www.radarbox.com/raspberry-pi/claim) and following the instructions

## Update `.env` file with sharing key

Inside your application directory \(`/opt/adsb`\), edit the `.env` file using your favourite text editor. Beginners may find the editor `nano` easy to use:

```bash
nano /opt/adsb/.env
```

This file holds all of the commonly used variables \(such as our latitude, longitude and altitude\). We're going to add our `rbfeeder` sharing key to this file. Add the following line to the file:

```bash
RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY=YOURSHARINGKEY
```

* Replace `YOURSHARINGKEY` with the sharing key that was generated in the previous step.

For example:

```bash
RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY=g45643ab345af3c5d5g923a99ffc0de9
```

## Deploying `rbfeeder`

### Create `rbfeeder` container

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file that was created when deploying `ultrafeeder`.

Append the following lines to the end of the file \(inside the `services:` section\):

```yaml
  rbfeeder:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: rbfeeder
    restart: always
    environment:
      - BEASTHOST=ultrafeeder
      - LAT=${FEEDER_LAT}
      - LONG=${FEEDER_LONG}
      - ALT=${FEEDER_ALT_M}
      - TZ=${FEEDER_TZ}
      - SHARING_KEY=${RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY}
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log
```

If you are in the USA and are also running the `dump978` container with a second SDR, add the following additional lines to the `environment:` section:

```yaml
      - UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978
```

To explain what's going on in this addition:

* We're creating a container called `rbfeeder`, from the image `ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox:latest`.
* We're passing several environment variables to the container:
  * `BEASTHOST=ultrafeeder` to inform the feeder to get its ADSB data from the container `ultrafeeder` over our private `adsbnet` network.
  * `LAT` will use the `FEEDER_LAT` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `LONG` will use the `FEEDER_LONG` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `ALT` will use the `FEEDER_ALT_M` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `TZ` will use the `FEEDER_TZ` variable from your `.env` file.
  * `SHARING_KEY` will use the `RADARBOX_SHARING_KEY` variable from your `.env` file.
* For people running `dump978`:
  * `UAT_RECEIVER_HOST=dump978` specifies the host to pull UAT data from; in this instance our `dump978` container.
* We're using `tmpfs` for volumes that have regular I/O. Any files stored in a `tmpfs` mount are temporarily stored outside the container's writable layer. This helps to reduce:
  * The size of the container, by not writing changes to the underlying container; and
  * SD Card or SSD wear

## Update `ultrafeeder` container configuration

Before running `docker compose`, we also want to update the configuration of the `ultrafeeder` container, so that it generates MLAT data for piaware.

Open the `docker-compose.yml` and make the following environment value is part of the `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` variable to the `ultrafeeder` service:

```yaml
      - ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=mlathub,rbfeeder,30105,beast_in;
```

To explain this addition, the `ultrafeeder` container will connect to the `rbfeeder` container on port `30105` and receive MLAT data. This data will then be included in any outbound data streams from `ultrafeeder`.

## Refresh running containers

Once the file has been updated, issue the command `docker compose up -d` in the application directory to apply the changes and bring up the `rbfeeder` container. You should see the following output:

```text
ultrafeeder is up-to-date
piaware is up-to-date
fr24 is up-to-date
Creating rbfeeder
```

We can view the logs for the environment with the command `docker compose logs`, or continually "tail" them with `docker compose logs -f`. At this stage, the logs will be fairly unexciting and look like this:

```text
[s6-init] making user provided files available at /var/run/s6/etc...exited 0.
[s6-init] ensuring user provided files have correct perms...exited 0.
[fix-attrs.d] applying ownership & permissions fixes...
[fix-attrs.d] done.
[cont-init.d] executing container initialization scripts...

[cont-init.d] 01-rbfeeder: exited 0.
[cont-init.d] done.

We can see our container running with the command `docker ps`.

Once running, you can visit the RadarBox website, and go to "Account" &gt; "Stations" and click your station to see your live data.
