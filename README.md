Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast \(ADS-B\) is a safety and surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked.

These ADS-B data can be received by ~~nerds~~ enthusiasts using Software Defined Radio \(SDR\), and shared with aggregators, which collect, combine, and redistribute flight information for fun and profit.

## Objective

This guide will walk you through the process to deploy and configure Docker containers to allow reception and decoding of ADS-B data, as well as submission to various flight tracking services, both open and commercial, and the visualisation of this data.
