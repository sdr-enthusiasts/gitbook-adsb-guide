## All This Feels Like Too Much

While following this guide is a great way to learn more about Docker and to better understand a fairly complex system with many interconnected components, some people might prefer the __easy__ button. You can get a simple to use image designed for common single board computers, including most of the recent Raspberry Pis, that comes with a straight forward Web UI and hides all of the complexity described here from you. You can find more about this at the [ADSB Feeder Image website](https://adsb.im/home). This project is built on top of the containers described in this document and actively maintained in collaboration with the maintainers of these containers (as well as the authors of some of the underlying tools). Questions about this project can be posted at the Discord mentioned above or in the [dedicated Zulip channel](https://adsblol.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/391168-adsb-feeder-image).

But now back to the in depth technical information about how to set up your own feeder.
