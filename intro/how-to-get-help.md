# How to Get Help

You can get help by [joining my Discord](https://discord.gg/sTf9uYF), and asking your question in the `#adsb-containers` channel. I'm in Western Australia so if you don't get a response immediately it might be due to time zones or sleep. There are a bunch of friendly and knowledgeable people there who would be happy to help if I'm away.

Furthermore, I welcome any feedback on this document. If you think a section needs better instructions or further explanation, or if anything doesn't work for you, please let me know through the channels above so that I can continue to improve this document. [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/gitbook-adsb-guide/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/gitbook-adsb-guide/pulls) with suggested changes!
