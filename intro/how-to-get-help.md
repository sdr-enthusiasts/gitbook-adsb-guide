# How to Get Help

You can get help by [joining my Discord](https://discord.gg/sTf9uYF), and asking your question in the `#adsb-containers` channel. I'm in Western Australia so if you don't get a response immediately it might be due to time zones or sleep. There are a bunch of friendly and knowledgeable people there who would be happy to help if I'm away.

Furthermore, we welcome any feedback on this document. If you think a section needs better instructions or further explanation, or if anything doesn't work for you, please let us know through the channels above so that we can continue to improve this document.
