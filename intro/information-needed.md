# Information Needed

During this guide, you'll need the following information at hand:

* The altitude \(above sea level\) of your antenna. To find this, you can either use a GPS, or use something like [https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm) to zoom in on the exact spot of your antenna, and then add the distance above ground level your antenna is located.
* The latitude and longitude of your antenna \(to at least five decimal places\). To find this, you can use the output from the elevation finder above, or you can use a GPS, or use maps.google.com to zoom in on the exact spot of your antenna, and click to get the latitude and longitude.
