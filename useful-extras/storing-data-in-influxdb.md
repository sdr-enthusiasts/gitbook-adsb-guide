# Storing Data and Metrics in a Time Series Database

The `readsb-protobuf` container also contains InfluxData's [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/), and can send flight data and `readsb` metrics to InfluxDB or Prometheus. [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/) is not started by default. `INFLUXDBURL` must be set in order to start the built-in [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/) instance.

## InfluxDB Options

These variables control the sending of flight data and readsb metrics to [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/) (via a built-in instance of [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/)).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `INFLUXDBURL` | The full HTTP URL for your InfluxDB instance. Required for both InfluxDB v1 and v2. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDBUSERNAME` | If using authentication, a username for your InfluxDB instance. If not using authentication, leave unset. Not required for InfluxDB v2. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDBPASSWORD` | If using authentication, a password for your InfluxDB instance. If not using authentication, leave unset. Not required for InfluxDB v2. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDB_V2` | Set to a non empty value to enable InfluxDB V2 output. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDB_V2_BUCKET` | Required if `INFLUXDB_V2` is set, bucket must already exist in your InfluxDB v2 instance. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDB_V2_ORG` | Required if `INFLUXDB_V2` is set. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDB_V2_TOKEN` | Required if `INFLUXDB_V2` is set. | Unset |
| `INFLUXDB_SKIP_AIRCRAFT` | Set to any value to skip publishing aircraft data to InfluxDB to minimize bandwidth and database size. | Unset |

## InfluxDB Schema

The database `readsb` will be created if it does not exist.

Within this database are the following measurements:

### `aircraft` Measurement

Tags and fields used for this measurement should match [Virtual Radar Server's JSON response ("the new way")](https://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/Documentation/Formats/AircraftList.aspx).

## Prometheus Options

These variables control exposing flight data and `readsb` metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) (via a built-in instance of [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/)).

## Grafana Dashboard

If you're using `INFLUXDBURL` and pushing metrics into InfluxDB, [@mikenye](https://github.com/mikenye) has put together a sample Grafana dashboard, which can be found [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13168).

Due to the performance requirements it is not recommended to run Grafana on a Raspberry Pi.
